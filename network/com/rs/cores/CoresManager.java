/**
 * The CoresManager is responsible for initializing thread behavior.
 *
 * The key things to remember about the game engine are as follows:<br/>
 * <br/>
 *
 * The main thread handles game-tick based tasks, such as {@code WorldTask}s and
 * general game actions. Therefore, if performing a scheduled or delayed
 * execution based on game ticks, use the
 * {@code WorldTasksManager.schedule(...)} approach.<br/>
 * <br/>
 *
 * The {@code slowExecutor} manages a pool of threads dedicated to running
 * either continuously repeated tasks, or {@link FixedLengthRunnable} objects.
 * In either of these cases, the frequency of the {@code run()} call is not
 * bound to game ticks - it runs for the specified interval with a specified
 * time unit.<br/>
 * <br/>
 *
 * The {@code fastExecutor} manages a pool of threads dedicated to running
 * single-execution {@link Runnable}s immediately after they are submitted for
 * execution. Like the {@code slowExecutor}, the start delay of the
 * {@code run()} call is not bound to game ticks - it will run as soon as the
 * thread pool supplies a thread to run it.<br/>
 * <br/>
 *
 * "then it (the {@code fastExecutor}) shouldn't carry the downfall of the timer
 * based system. "<br/>
 * 
 * <pre>
 *     - Noele, when (indirectly) talking about the inconsistencies
 *       of mixing threading APIs in a fully multi-threaded system.
 * </pre>
 *
 *
 * Exactly! But, with the way we have implemented it, it (the
 * {@code fastExecutor}) doesn't! The underlying thread pool executor objects
 * ({@code slowExecuter} and {@code fastExecutor}) are of a different type; one
 * is a subclass of a {@link ScheduledExecutorService} ({@code slowExecuter})
 * and the other is a subclass of {@link ExecutorService}
 * ({@code fastExecutor}).<br/>
 * <br/>
 *
 * The {@code fastExecutor} can only call {@code execute(Runnable r)},
 * {@code call(Callable c)}, and {@code submit(Runnable r)}, all of which do the
 * same thing: run a {@link Runnable} once and only once, and as soon as a
 * thread is supplied from the thread pool.<br/>
 * <br/>
 *
 * The {@code slowExecuter} also has {@code execute(Runnable r)}, but also has
 * things like {@code schedule(...)}, {@code scheduleWithFixedDelay(...)}, ... ,
 * which allow it to repeat tasks, or start tasks after a delay.<br/>
 * <br/>
 *
 * These methods might be common knowledge, but it is important to stress the
 * fundamental reason that both the {@code slowExecuter} and
 * {@code fastExecutor} exist; each has a separate thread pool maintaining them.
 * Unique thread pools mapped to a unique type of threaded service. Good for
 * organization, good for resource management.<br/>
 * <br/>
 *
 * Furthermore, with the {@link ServiceProvider}, all of this functionality is
 * wrapped in a class which is responsible for choosing the correct executor
 * service to use.<br/>
 * <br/>
 *
 * For those of you TL;DR nerds: we no longer use a {@link java.util.Timer}
 * object for the {@code fastExecutor}, as its functionality will be deprecated
 * in Java 9, and quite frankly, because it is ancient history when compared to
 * the {@code Executors} framework. We instead use a custom manager called a
 * {@code ServiceProvider} to use the executor services.<br/>
 * <br/>
